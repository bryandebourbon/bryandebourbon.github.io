        <h2>Your Privacy Matters</h2>
        <p>PicoCal was designed to value your privacy. Our use of the HealthKit framework is designed to enhance your experience by helping you track your fitness achievements directly within our app.</p>
    
        <h3>Data Use and Collection</h3>
        <p>With your permission, our app collects data on calories burned from HealthKit. This information is used exclusively to determine whether you have reached your goal of burning 800 calories or more. Achieving this goal is visually represented by a green square in calendar date history, providing a simple and motivational way to track your progress.</p>
    
        <h3>Data Storage and Protection</h3>
        <p>Your health data, including calories burned, is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers. </p>
    
        <h3>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
        <p>We do not share your health data with third parties. Your fitness achievements, represented by the green square, are for your personal motivation only. No individual data is ever shared without explicit consent.</p>
    
        <h3>User Rights</h3>
        <p>You have complete control over your health data. At any time, you can revoke our app's access to your HealthKit data through your device's settings. Should you have any questions or wish to request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data collected by our app, please contact us at bdebourbon@me.com .</p>
    
        <h3>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice within our app prior to the change becoming effective.</p>
